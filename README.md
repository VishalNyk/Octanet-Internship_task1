Task 1 of this internship was to build a landing page using any technology stack.
As this was only a landing page, so I mainly used HTML/CSS and little bit of JS. Bootstrap is majorly used, for design purposes.
Also the knowledge of various css components, flexbox, javaScript is required. The page is not the exact replica of the actual landing page of Octanet Pvt. Limited but I tried to build the design like the actual one.
